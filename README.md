# Lunch-Clock
The clock hands of an old clock should be moved with the help of a Raspberry Pi by reading its system time. The clock turns its clock hands by one minute if the polarity gets reversed. The clock should move its hands half times fast if the "lunch-time" button was pressed. If the button is pressed again the clock hands move twice as fast as usually until the actual time is reached. After that the clock moves the hands normally again.
